# TM-and-CC-and-GPI-prediction
This is a tool for a search for candidate genes of the tetherin/bst2 gene family in vertebrates. The search is based on three different characteristic motifs found in all members of this gene family. The defined protein motifs are: transmembrane regions, coiled-coil structure and GPI (glycophosphatidylinositol) modification/anchor. The tool developed in this work takes as an input region of a DNA and automates search and identification of motifs, than creates clear textual and graphics output in a form of HTML page. Because of a relatively broad definition of characteristic motifs the tool is meant as a helper for an expert and is focused on presenting complex outputs from standard algorithms in a user friendly way.

How you can get started with the project:
- there is no installation needed
- needed Linux OS with Python >= 3.8
- - additional information will be added soon
